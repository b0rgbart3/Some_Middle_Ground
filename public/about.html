        <blockquote class="aboutSubhead">In today's America, constructive debate about social issues has broken down. We
            don’t just disagree on policies anymore. We disagree about what’s true, and what news can be trusted.

            Middle|Ground aims to shine a light on the imbalanced and sometimes inaccurate news we receive through
            social
            media which inform our opinions, to promote greater perspective and dialogue about issues of social
            importance.

            Inspired by a powerful <a href="https://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/)">"Blue Feed Red Feed" visual
                created by the Wall Street Journal in 2016</a>, Middle|Ground v1 offers side-by-side comparison of
            recent
            social media streams from the news sources deemed most trusted by people with “liberal” and “conservative”
            ideologies. Users can search by topic of interest and see how these topics are represented on social media

        <p class="aboutParagraph">
            In addition, Middle|Ground harnesses the Google Fact Check API to show any claims related to the topic which
            have been
            fact-checked, along with any conclusion reached on whether the claims are partly or mostly true or false.
