He did great, esp for being out of practice and competing from a vacation home at high altitude.  I'm proud of his courage.  He didn't make it past Round 1 BUT we can try to vote him back in for Round 2.  He wants another shot!  He's got more fire and way more tricks in his bag. 

Please help vote him back into round 2 for another chance! Voting is open till 7pm PDT on Monday.  Just go to the YouTube link and there should be a poll in the comments.  Thanks for the support!",
